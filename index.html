            <h2>Welcome to My Professional Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
                Explore my journey in Identity and Access Management, my academic background, and professional achievements.
            </p>
            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>                
                Hi, I’m <strong>Julio Borba</strong> a Cybersecurity and Identity & Access Management (IAM) specialist with over a decade of experience helping organizations secure 
                what matters most: their people, data, and infrastructure.
            <br>
            <br>
                My journey began in Brazil as a Support Analyst, where I cut my teeth monitoring networks and managing incidents. That early exposure sparked my passion for security,
                which quickly grew into a career focused on protecting complex digital environments. Since 2012, I’ve specialized in IAM and Privileged Access Management, implementing
                and managing tools like <strong>CyberArk, Centrify, Varonis, and SailPoint</strong> across global enterprises, such as Mitusbish Bank, Experian, Itau, BNP Paribas,
                Ajinomoto, Vale among others.
            <br>
            <br>
                I’ve held roles from hands-on analyst to technical architect and now lead teams as an <strong>Information Security Coordinator</strong> at SERASA Experian, 
                where I design and scale IAM programs across multiple cloud platforms including <strong>AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
                My international experience has taken me from Brazil to <strong>Costa Rica</strong> and now to <strong>Canada</strong>, working with multicultural teams and 
                supporting global operations across the <strong>Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia</strong>. Along the way, I’ve participated in job rotations, led major
                migrations, and developed deep expertise in securing access in large-scale environments. Currently based in <strong>New Westminster, BC</strong>, I’m also pursuing a 
                <strong>Diploma in Computing Studies and Information Systems</strong> at Douglas College to continue evolving alongside the rapidly shifting cybersecurity landscape.
                I’m fluent in <strong>Portuguese, English, and Spanish</strong>, with intermediate French, and I bring not just technical 
                skill but a passion for building secure, scalable systems that empower people to work safely and confidently.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
            <p>
                As digital identities become more critical and threat landscapes more complex, my mission is to stay at the forefront—whether by leading IAM strategies, advising on 
                secure cloud adoption, or shaping the next generation of cybersecurity architecture.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
                Let’s build a safer digital future together.
