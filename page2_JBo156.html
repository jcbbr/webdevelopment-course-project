                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Colégio São Luís, is a private Jesuit educational institution located in São Paulo, Brazil. 
                    It was founded in 1867 in the city of Itu and later moved to São Paulo in 1917. 
                    The school offers full-time education, including early childhood, elementary, and high school levels. 
                    It has a rich history and notable alumni, such as Ayrton Senna and Eduardo Suplicy.
                    earned my high school diploma after receiving a scholarship to study at Colégio São Luís, 
                    coming from a poor region of São Paulo; this opportunity greatly enhanced my education and future prospects.
