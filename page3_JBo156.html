            <h2>Languages I Speak</h2>
            <p>
                I am fluent in multiple languages, which has been a valuable asset in my career. My language skills have allowed me to communicate effectively with colleagues
                and clients from diverse backgrounds, and have helped me to build strong relationships in the workplace. I believe that language is a powerful tool for connecting
                with others, and I am committed to continuing to improve my language skills. My language skills have also given me a deeper understanding of different cultures
                and perspectives, which has enriched my personal and professional life and it have played a key role in my success in the field of Identity and Access Management. 
                I am always looking for opportunities to improve my language skills and expand my cultural knowledge. Here are the languages I speak:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>Portuguese (Native)</strong>
                    <p>I am a native Portuguese speaker, having grown up in Brazil.</p>
                </li> 
                <li><strong>English (Fluent)</strong>
                    <p>I have been learning English since I was 10 years old. I have a C1 level of proficiency in English which I achieved through a combination of formal education
                        and self-study. I have taken several courses and exams to improve my skills, including the IELTS exam, which I passed with a high score. 
                        I also practice my speaking and writing skills regularly by engaging in conversations with native speakers and also by reading and consuming English content.
                        My English skills have been further enhanced by my experience working with Global teams, where I worked in a bilingual environment and interacted with English-speaking
                        colleagues and clients. I have also traveled to English-speaking countries like England, USA and Canada, which has helped me to improve my listening and speaking skills.
                </li>            
                <li><strong>Spanish (Fluent)</strong>
                    <p>I started to learn Spanish when I lived in Costa Rica, where I worked for a year and half. I achieved the fluency through a combination of self-study and daily
                        immersion in the Costa Rican Culture. The daily interactions with locals, as well as the exposure to Spanish media, helped me to develop my language skills
                        quickly. I had the opportunity to use these skills in my work later when I get back to Brazil, where I communicated with Spanish-speaking clients
                        and colleagues.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>French (Intermediate)</strong>
                    <p>I have been learning French for a few years now, and I have achieved an intermediate level of proficiency. I have taken several courses and exams to 
                        improve my skills, including the TCF exam, which I passed with a B2 level. I had the opportunitt to practice my French skills while travelling to Quebec,
                        where I had the chance to interact with French-speaking locals and immerse myself in the culture. 
                        I am committed to continuing to improve my French skills and expand my cultural knowledge.
                    </p>
                </li>

            <p class="whitetext">The importance of language for our brain has been studied by many researchers. 
                Here is a video that explains how learning a new language can help to improve our cognitive abilities and brain function.
                The video discusses the benefits of bilingualism and how it can enhance our memory, problem-solving skills, and overall brain health.
